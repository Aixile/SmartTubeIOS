## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/milika/SmartTubeIOS
cd SmartTubeIOS
open SmartTube.xcworkspace
```

### Signing

Select your Apple Developer team in Xcode's Signing & Capabilities for the app and its extensions, and use unique bundle identifiers. For a free Personal Team, use the local-only build without iCloud or App Groups entitlements.

For configuration-based signing, copy `SmartTubeApp/Config/Secrets.xcconfig.example` to `SmartTubeApp/Config/Secrets.xcconfig` and set `SMARTTUBE_TEAM_ID` and `SMARTTUBE_TV_TEAM_ID`. Target-level team overrides in Xcode take precedence.

Firebase is not included. No `GoogleService-Info.plist` or Firebase account is needed; diagnostics stay in the device's local system log.

---

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. See [.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) for the checklist.  
Please ensure `Secrets.xcconfig` and `GoogleService-Info.plist` are **never** included in a PR.
